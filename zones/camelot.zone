Narrowing Path^
You have followed this narrow path to this huge structure you could

An entryway leads into the castle to the north. A narrow path leads back

Entry to Camelot^
You stand in the entrance to the fabled castle of Camelot, seat of

leading to the east and west, and the great hall to the north.

The walls are covered with tapestries showing the valor and chivalry
of King Arthur's knights. Here you see King Arthur and Sir Launcelot
at there first meeting, there you see Sir Percivale, at his knighting
ceremony.

Great Hall^
Banners displaying the coats of arms of King Arthur's knights hang

ladies, celebrating another of King Arthur's victories.

The Camelot Armory^
Racks of unfinished weapons and armor fill the room, while one entire
wall is taken up by the massive forges used by the castle armorers in
the pursuit of their craft. The heat here is incredible, and you
marvel that the smiths are able to work so hard in such heat.

Throne Room^
Although the entire room is filled with wonders, your eyes are drawn
again and again to the mighty war banner of King Arthur, hanging on
the wall behind his throne. The dragon, worked in gold thread,
ripples as a draft moves the cloth, and it seems to you that it is
almost alive, ready to spring down from it's perch to defend it's master.

The Hall of the Round Table^
Before you stands the legendary round table of King Arthur. Behind
each of the chairs hangs a portrait of an honored Knight. Looking at
the portraits, you can see honor and chivalry in their eyes. All but

his eyes you see only a cold calculating evil.

Yeenoghu's Room^
At first glance, Yeenoghu resembles a human. But his head is that
of a hyena, his chest is rather canine in form, his feet are paws,
and his hands are clawed. He is thin to the point of being
skeletal, and his only body hair is a putrid yellow crest running
to mid-back. His skin is dead gray, and his amber eyes glow evilly
in the darkness.

Nalfeshnee's Room^
Nasty demons of this ilk combine the worst features of an ape and a
boar. Their wings are small, but somehow manage to carry their
weight in flight.

Demogorgon's Room^
Demogorgon could be the most powerful of all demons. He is
reptilian and 18 feet tall. He has two heads, with baboon-like
faces, scaley blue-green skin and tentacles instead of arms.

Family Room^
The furniture in this room seems to be slightly less opulent then
in other parts of the Keep, as if it was selected more for comfort
then for style or appearances. A large stone fireplace is set into
the north wall, and the furniture is arranged around it, so that
all guests will be comfortable and at a conversational distance.

Master Bedroom^
This room was obviously designed with one thing in mind. Pleasure.
The walls are of white marble, and the floor is covered by a thick
white rug, made from some sort of fur. The draperies over the
windows are red, and give a warm glow to the rest of the room. The
single item of furniture takes up almost all available floor space.
