The diary is old and many of its pages are missing.  As you read it, an
incredible tale unfolds.  The writer of the diary was part of an expedition
which set out three months ago to find El Dorado, a mythical city which
supposedly lies in the great rainforest to the south-east.  The expedition
crossed this great mountain range, then descended into the rainforest and set
out on their ambitious quest.  After some time they had a major disagreement
and the group split up, one half continuing to battle through the forest while
the other built a raft and floated down the river.  The writer of the diary was
in the party which took the slow route through the jungle.  During weeks of
fruitless searching the party gradually dwindled, one by one falling victim to
one or other of the jungle's manifold hazards.  When there were only a handful
left, they abandoned their quest and attempted to return home.  The final
entries in the diary are increasingly surreal, and it is plain that the writer
was steadily losing his grip on reality."

    You are deep in the rainforest.  The distant roar of a waterfall to the

monkeys, the raucous cries of parakeets, and the sibilant chatter of myriad
insects.

Slippery Bank^
    You take care to keep away from the edge here, for the bank of the river
is muddy and you fear piranhas.  The river is wide at this point, too wide to
swim across, so unless you have a boat you will have to continue along the bank
either east or west from here.

Hardwood Trees^
    You are struck by how many different species of trees populate this forest.
In this spot you count several tall hardwood varieties, with tall unbranching
trunks that make them valuable for timber.  Lapachos, curapays and spanish
cedars are notable amongst them, but there are many more that you do not
recognise.  There are exits in all directions.

River Bank^
    You find your way blocked by a fallen tree which sticks out into the middle of the river.  You find yourself unable to climb it since its trunk is smooth

Entrance To The Burrow^
    You are in a relatively open part of the forest.  The canopy overhead is

wonder what kind of animal might have made it.

Insects' Deathtrap^
    Between two bushes here a large spider's web is stretched.  When you tug
gently on one of the strands, a pair of very large, very hairy legs appears
from within one of the bushes.  You hastily withdraw your hand and, after a
short while, the legs retreat.  You then notice a number of packages, cocooned
in silk, and you marvel at the size of them, then reflect on the size of their
nemesis.  To the east you see a glint of water.

Lagoon^
    You are up to your knees in water.  A number of narrow channels run off
from the sides of the lagoon to join the river to the south.  Since you know
there is also a river close by to the north, you begin to feel somewhat hemmed
in.  To the north a dense cluster of swamp-living trees bars your way.

River's Edge^
    You are standing on a narrow strip of sand by the edge of the river.  The
water is still moving fairly fast here, but it has a sedate quality, gliding
eastward with a serene assurance.  You find that you cannot proceed any further
east here, for a tangled mass of woody plants to the south grows out into the
river to the east.

Where Rivers Join^
    You realise that you can go no further.  Here the Kerapi river is joined

ground here is soggy and your feet are wet through.  You will have to return
west.

River Shore^
    You are on the bank of the River Malazon.  Small trees grow out from the

cruising about not far beneath the surface.  As fruit falls from the trees into
the water, the fish quickly rush towards it and gobble it up.  You scan the
murk for signs of piranhas but can see none.  You can go north or west along
the river bank.

Shady Waters^
    Leafy branches droop over the water, bending so far down that their
outermost tips actually dip beneath the surface of the river, forming a tunnel

dark and dense, and the calls of its denizens fill the air.  To the east you
can follow the river bank, while to the west you can climb on to a high rock by
the water's edge.

Atop The Rock^
    You are perched on the top of a high rock, a boulder perhaps, brought down
from the mountains in an ancient time of ice when glaciers reached down even to
this level.  From this vantage point you can see quite a long way down the
river to the east, but unfortunately you are not high enough to see over the
tops of the trees.  A vertical drop off the rock to the west means that you
will have to head back east.

forest56 e:forest58 s:forest54;
lflags {Outdoors RainForest}
Thick Forest^
    This is a very thick part of the forest.  The trees are not noticeably
closer together, but their foliage is less dense and thus more light reaches
the ground here than did in the forest across the river.  The effect of this is
that the undergrowth flourishes, producing vast and rambling forms that
obstruct you at every turn.  To the south the way back to the river is easy
enough, while to the east you think you can manage to squeeze through the
bushes.

Sandy Bank^
    You are at the edge of a wide strip of sand, constantly lapped by the water
and no doubt frequently submerged.  For now though it appears to be a place
where caimans rest, and as you arrive a few of them slide into the water,
hopefully considering you too large to be easy prey.  At this point the river
bends gently round to the south as it goes downstream, so if you continue east
you will be heading into the jungle.  North will also take you into thicker
growth, while to the west you can follow the bank up the river again.

Forgotten Meander^
    You are standing beside a narrow arc of water which does not appear to be

wide loop of the river, now left behind by the constant shifting of the banks.
One day, maybe, the river will reclaim it, but for now it serves little purpose
other than to bar your way north.

water which comes halfway up your shins.  The going is slow, and every time you

beneath.  Looking east you can see more of the same kind of ground, but it is

of trees in this area, and all around you the trees are plentiful.  To the

impractical.

Inlet^
    You are wading through a small inlet that runs northwards from the edge of

a soggy environment, since there is no dry land in which to find a foothold.
Instead, slender trees send wide branching roots downwards for many feet,
burying them deep in the mud for firm anchorage, while their manifold branches
intermingle with those of their nearest neighbours for additional support.  The

Under The Kapok Tree^
    A terrible smell assaults your nostrils as you pause at the base of an
enormous kapok tree.  You discover, nestling between the tall thin roots of the

incredibly noxious odour.  It is a stinking corpse flower and well deserves its
name.

Bell Bird's Territory^
    You are deep within the rainforest.  As you pause here you become aware of
an at first intriguing, then after a while intensely annoying, sound.  It
sounds as if an anvil is repeatedly being struck by an hammer.  The noise is the
call of the bell bird, and it will happily spend all day sitting on its branch
high above you doing nothing else but make this strange sound.  After a short
time it begins to irritate you and you become keen to move on.

Shady Bank^
    You are on the bank of a small tributary, just twenty yards or so in width
at this stage.  To the west is a tangled bush which you can only circumvent by

ferns and palms spread their fronds over the water.

In The Shallows^
    You are wading through tea-coloured water, your feet fortunately on firm
sand rather than thick yielding mud.  The water is cool and pleasant, and comes
as a relief in the humid heat of the jungle.  A tall tree has fallen into the
river to the west, and you prefer to ignore that direction rather than wading
in deeper to try to get around it.

Before The Quicksand^
    You almost put your foot into a patch of quicksand but notice it just in

this direction.

River Shore^
    You are on the southern bank of the river Malazon.  Small water-loving

Fig Tree^
    You are standing at the base of a strangling fig, which started life as a
seedling growing on the trunk of another tree.  As the fig grew it came to
dominate its host, wrapping its branches around it and choking it, until the
tree within was dead and the fig strong enough to stand alone.  You can go in
any direction.

Shallow Tributary^
    You are up to your knees in the water.  From here you can go west past the

Bank Of The Tributary^
    You are wandering along the bank of a small river which flows lazily by to
the south.  A rich proliferation of trees grows here, despite the infertility
of the soil.  You find it surprising that such a diversity could arise from
what is virtually pure sand.

Sheltered Cove^
    The shore here curves inwards in a small arc, forming a bay in which the
water is of uniform depth.  If it weren't so muddy you might consider having

or west along the river bank or south into the forest.

Heart Of The Rainforest^
    The forest floor here is clear, and the thin layer of leaf litter firm
under your feet.  In the subpolar forests a pine needle may take seven years to
decay; a fallen oak leaf in a temperate forest will disappear in a year or so,
yet in these humid conditions any leaf that falls will have completely rotted
away within six weeks.  As you study the leaf litter you see thousands of tiny
fungi toiling at the process of decay.

River Bank^
    You are on the bank of a small river.  To the east it curves around to the

of the rainforest.

Deep Forest^
    You are in an open part of the forest.  Far above your head the canopy
forms a roof through which only a small proportion of the sun's light
penetrates.  Much closer to the ground is the understorey, comprising short
saplings and palms which are adapted to the dim light conditions.  You can go

Palm Trees^
    You are standing under a small grove of palm trees.  Far above their

Kapok Avenue^
    You are in a curious arrangement of trees: an avenue running from east to
west.  On either side of the avenue are tall kapok trees which reach high above
the canopy, collecting a great deal of the sun's light.  Why they have grown in
such a fashion though is a mystery.  It does not seem to be have occurred
naturally.  But if somebody planted them, then whom?  And why?

It is a relic of an ancient civilisation, though judging from the rather poor

    A more unattractive name for a location you could not imagine, yet that is

Following The River Bank^
    The bank is muddy for a long way along the southern bank, and you keep to

to find a way into the forest further along the bank.

Under The Trees^
    You are on the bank of the river, overshadowed by a clump of trees which
reach out over the water, dropping into it red berries from time to time, where
they are quickly snapped up by fish darting up from the bottom.  Such fish will
carry the seeds for miles up or down the river where they will deposit them to
grow at the water's edge.  Thus do these fruit trees propagate.  You try a
berry experimentally but find the taste highly unpleasant.

    The water here is stained the colour of tea by the tannin from the leaves
falling into it from the trees above.  The water is shallow and flowing fairly
slowly so you do not immediately get washed downstream and can decide whether
you wish to clamber ashore to the north or south.

Junction Of Rivers^
    Technically speaking, this is the River Kerapi, which has just been joined
by the Malazon flowing in from the south-west.  For some time henceforward, the
water from the two rivers flows side by side, the difference in colour rather
striking.  The river is too fast-moving for you to try to head back upstream,
but you may be able to reach the northern or southern shore with some strenuous
paddling.

River Malazon^
    You are on the River Malazon.  The water, though slow-moving, is still too
swift for you to travel against its flow.  You could perhaps gain the shore to
the south, but to the north the trees are too thick to attempt a landing there.

River Kerapi^
    You are floating down the middle of the river, following its meanders with
great ease.  With a great deal of effort you may be able to paddle back
upstream since the water is not flowing very swiftly at this point.  The river
is very wide, but you could gain the shore to north or south if you wish.

River Kerapi^
    You are gently cruising on an increasingly wide river.  You are fairly
close to the northern shore here, a bend in the river having caused you to
drift naturally closer to the shore.  You could beach here if you wish, or you
could continue to follow the river in a roughly easterly direction.

Midstream^
    You are in the middle of the river.  Here it is very wide indeed, perhaps
half a mile from bank to bank.  The river is flowing from north to south at
this point, having just swung around a long bend.  Further south it bends again
and resumes its eastward course.

    You are near to the bank of the river.  The bushes on the shore are quite
close and you think you can see movement among them.  You can head up or down
the river, or west back into midstream.

Midstream^
    You are in the middle of the river.  Since the influx of more tributaries,
both large and small, the expanse of water has grown staggeringly wide.  To the
north and south the banks seem dim and distant.  You can go in any direction.

    You are floating along close by to the north bank of the Kerapi river.  The
bushes on the shore rustle ominously, and once or twice you catch a glimpse of
people moving about amongst them.  You fear to climb ashore here, but you can
go in any other direction.

Midstream^
    You are floating along the middle of the river.  The water is flowing very
slowly and sluggishly here, and you wonder if you are perhaps approaching the
sea.  Certainly the river is so wide that you can barely see both banks to the
north and south.

    You are in the middle of the river, alone and surrounded by more water than
you would have thought could possibly be contained in one river.  The banks to
north and south are now just out of sight below the horizon.  You can go in any
direction.

    You are still a long way from the shore here, although you realise that if
you go much nearer you would bring yourself within range of Indian arrows.  To
your astonishment you see a small ocean-going ship perched atop one of the
trees some way in from the shoreline.  You cannot imagine how it got there.

    The river here is so wide it is almost a sea.  You can see trees in the
distance, but the shoreline on both sides is below the horizon.  To the east is
the sea, stretching for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of miles.  You can head in
any direction.

Cold Current^
    You find yourself caught up in a strong current which is sweeping up from
the southern polar regions.  You are powerless to prevent yourself being
carried northwards at considerable speed.  To the west the trees pass by in an
endless procession, and you begin to appreciate the vast size of it.

Carried Northward^
    You inevitably come to the end of the trees and then pass by a succession
of varied shorelines, the climate gradually becoming more and more temperate.
After what seems like an age, you begin to spot familiar landmarks.  Over to
the northwest is the volcano Mount Bandilbar, presiding over a verdant
landscape.  As you slowly draw level with it you see the mountains surrounding
the blizzard pass and, closer to you, the long stretch of shoreline to the east
of the village.  Ramshackle but comfortingly familiar, the Old Seadog looms
closer and you sigh as you finally feel you have come home at last.  The cold
southern current is now so weak as to be unnoticeable, and only your momentum
carries you the last half mile to the waters just east of the jetty.
